# Asymetical Asteroids
This is an asymetrical, co-op, multiplayer game based on the original [Asteroids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asteroids_(video_game)).

## What do you mean 'asymetrical'?
Well, one player controls and pilots the ship, avoiding danger and eliminating threats, while another player (on their phone) has control over the ship's systems and can deliver power to said systems.

**For Example:**
- Adding power to the engines increases the ship's speed
